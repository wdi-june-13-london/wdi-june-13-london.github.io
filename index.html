                    <p>WDI is General Assembly’s Web Development Immersive track. Think of it as bootcamp. We certainly have. To us, immersive means all day, every day, weekends and weeknights, for 12 weeks straight. Fifteen students, completely different backgrounds, all retrained as web developers.
                    Here is what we’ve accomplished. </p>

                            Prior to joining WDI, Anna studied economics in Italy.  Anna loves cats, reading and new experiences - and while cats were not as heavily featured as she hoped during the course, new experiences are exactly what WDI provided. Ruby wasn't the only language that Anna mastered: she also saw these twelve weeks as an opportunity to improve her English. She is moving to London and eager to find a job in the tech field, ideally with a fashion company.

                            After several years in client facing roles within marketing and product development, Jarkyn grew tired of watching developers have all the fun. She decided it was time to join them and therefore, has equipped herself with skills in both front-end and back-end coding through WDI. Passionate about UI/UX, design, cycling and yoga, Jarkyn is looking forward to spending days translating great ideas into great code.

                    <h2>Coding Masterpieces</h2>
                    <p>Practice makes perfect, so we put our skills to the test. Project 1 was an independent assignment: Music sharing app, GA scheduler or a Tic Tac Toe gaming platform. For Project 2 we teamed up in threes to create far more complex sites: an RSS feeder, a photo sharing app, a "cheerup" tweeting site, a dating app and a wifi sharing service. For the Final Project we were given the choice to work solo or in groups and on the topic of our choice. Below is just a small selection of some of the awesome things we’ve produced over the 12 week course.</p>
